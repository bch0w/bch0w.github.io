				<h2>Prospective Students</h2>
			</header>
			Students who are interested in working and studying at the <a href="https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>, surrounded by world-class research of the <a 	 href="https://www.gi.alaska.edu/">Geophysical Institute (GI)</a>,
			and world-class nature of Alaska, should check out information from the <a href="https://www.uaf.edu/geosciences/">Department of Geosciences</a> and the 
			<a href="https://www.gi.alaska.edu/research/seismology-and-geodesy">
			GI's Seismology and Geodesy group</a>.

			<br>See below for positions I am seeking students for. If you are interested in working with me on any of my <a href="research.html">research interests</a>, but do not see a related opening below, please reach out by <a href="mailto:bhchow@alaska.edu">email</a>. 
			<br>
			<br>I am happy to work with UAF undergraduate students to design and oversee a project to satisfy research credits, and open to working with prospective graduate students and postdocs on collaborative proposals for <a href="students.html#funding">student/postdoc funding opportunities.</a>

				<h2>Current Openings</h2>
			</header>
			<p><i>Funded positions for which I am seeking students or postdocs will be posted here. Positions are listed next to suggested degree track, but I am happy to work with students to determine what track is right for them. If you are interested in any of these topics please reach out by <a href="mailto:bhchow@alaska.edu">email</a>!</i>
			<br>
			<br><i>Prospective students will need to apply for admission through the Office of Admissions. To start this process, or for more information on geoscience degree programs, see <a href="https://catalog.uaf.edu/academic-departments/geoscience/">this Department of Geosciences webpage</a>.
			<ol>
				<li> <i><b>[Position Tentatively Filled]</b></i> Computational Planetary Seismology (MSc): Starting Fall 2025, I will have full funding for an MSc project to work on planetary seismology related to Venus, <a href="https://nasaepscor.alaska.edu/can/2023-can-awards/">funded through NASA</a>. This project will focus on modelling expected ground motion for a potential future Venus lander, using numerical wave propagation solvers and estimates of Venusian tectonics <i>(Posted June, 2024)</i>.


				<li> <b>Nuclear Explosion Monitoring (PhD or MSc)</b>: Available immediately, I have funding for one graduate student to work on <a href="https://watc.alaska.edu/">seismoacoustic research broadly related to nuclear explosion monitoring</a>. The project aims are flexible, and I am happy to work with potential students to create a project that meshes with their research interests (<i>Posted April, 2024</i>).

			<!-- <br>I do not currently have any positions open. However, those interested in working with me on problems related to seismic tomography, computational seismology, nuclear treaty monitoring (<i>or any ideas they may have!</i>), are encouraged to reach out by <a href="mailto:bhchow@alaska.edu">email</a> to discuss possibilities. -->
