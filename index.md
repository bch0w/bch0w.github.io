### About Me (abridged)

I am currently a doctoral candidate at the Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) and GNS Science, in Wellington, New Zealand.

Since January 2018, I have been pursuing a PhD in Geophysics, with an emphasis in Seismology. In 2017 I jointly received a Masters of Science in Theoretical Geophysics from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit채t M체nchen (LMU) and the Technische Universit채t M체nchen (TUM), in Munich, Germany. Prior to that in 2015, I received a Bachelor of Science in Physics with a minor in German Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). 

My research interests include seismic tomography, computational seismology, rotational seismology and seismic instrumentation. In my spare time I enjoy rock climbing, riding motorbikes and being outdoors.
