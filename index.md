### About Me (abridged)

I am currently a doctoral candidate at the Victoria University of Wellington (VUW) in Wellington, New Zealand, as well as GNS Science.

Since January 2017, I have been pursuing a PhD in Geophysics, with an emphasis in Seismology. I jointly received a Masters of Science in Theoretical Geophysics from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit채t M체nchen and the Technische Universit채t M체nchen, Germany. Before that I received a Bachelor of Science in Physics with a minor in German Studies for the University of California, Santa Barbara. 

My research interests include seismic tomography, computational seismology and seismic instrumentation. In my spare time I enjoy rock climbing, riding motorbikes and generally being outdoors.
