					<p><strong>[Trial Course]</strong> This course introduces geoscience graduate students to topics and tools in computational geoscience. Students will expand on their basic programming skills to: 1) learn how to optimize their own codes, 2) learn how to work on shared compute systems, 3) gain exposure to more advanced computational tools and topics.</p>

				<li><b><a href="teaching/geos419.html">GEOS419 &mdash; Solid Earth Geophysics</a> </b>
					<br><i>Course Description:</i> Concepts and techniques of geophysics including origin of the Earth, its structure, and large scale dynamic processes responsible for its surface features. Geophysical techniques including seismology, gravity, and magnetic methods are discussed along with measurements of the Earth's thermal structure, rotation rates and tidal effects. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<li><b><a href="teaching/geos604.html">GEOS604 &mdash; Seismology</a></b> 
					<br><i>Course Description:</i>  		Seismology is the study of elastic waves propagating through the Earth or other planetary bodies, and the sources that generate them. Such waves are most commonly generated by earthquakes, but may also be excited by oceanic and atmospheric phenomena (e.g., storms), and anthropogenic sources (e.g., explosions). In this course we will cover fundamental topics required to understand seismology, including: stress and strain, the elastic wave equation, ray theory, seismic phases and earthquakes. The course will build on these fundamentals to cover applied and technical topics in seismology, such as: reflection/refraction seismology, tomography, signal processing, seismometry, and an overview of modern topics in seismology.
				<br>
				<br>
				<li><b>(Prospective) Introduction to Computational Geosciences</b>
					<br><i>Course Plan:</i> I envision this course as an introduction to topics and tools in computational geoscience that may facilitate students in journey in modern geosciences, which has become deeply intertwined with computing. This course is meant to be a follow-on of Programming and Automation for Geoscientists (<a href="https://github.com/uafgeoteach/GEOS636_PAG">GEOS636</a>), where students will have been introduced to basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, terminal navigation, shell scripting etc. This class would build from that foundation to explore topics in OOP, parallel programming, high performance computing, numerical methods and collaborative coding.
