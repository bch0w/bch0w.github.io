			As part of my responsibility as an assistant professor of seismology within the <a href="https://www.uaf.edu/geosciences/">Department of Geosciences</a>, I will begin teaching the following courses starting Spring semester AY2025&ndash;2026. See the <a href="https://catalog.uaf.edu/courses/geos/">UAF course catalog</a> for more information. 
			<br>
			<br>As I develop these courses, course material and resources will be posted here. These courses will be built from the ground up so if you have any suggestions, feedback or comments, please feel free to share!

			<ul>
				<li><b>Solid Earth Geophysics (GEOS419) // Spring semester 2025 + future offerings TBD; Co-taught with Carl Tape</b>
					<br><i>Course Description:</i> Concepts and techniques of geophysics including origin of the Earth, its structure and large scale dynamic processes responsible for its surface features. Geophysical techniques including seismology, gravity and magnetic methods are discussed along with measurements of the Earth's thermal structure, rotation rates and tidal effects. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<li><b>Seismology (GEOS604) // Spring semester 2025 and Spring odd-numbered years following</b> 
					<br><i>Course Description:</i>  Seismology is the study of waves propagating through the Earth. These waves are most commonly generated by earthquakes, but can also be generated by surface processes such as oceans and atmosphere like storms, and by anthropogenic sources like explosions. In Seismology we will cover fundamental topics required to understanding this field of study, including: stress and strain, the elastic wave equation, fourier transforms and signal processing, ray theory, reflection/refraction seismology, body waves, surface waves, and seismotectonics. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<li><b>Advanced Programming for Geosciences // Tentative special topic in AY2026&ndash;2027 </b>
					<br><i>Course Description:</i> I envision this class as an introduction to topics and tools in computational geoscience that may facilitate students in their day-to-day research. This course is meant to be a follow-on (++) of Programming and Automation for Geoscientists (GEOS636), where students should have learned about basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, terminal navigation and shell scripting. This class will take off from there to explore topics inclduing: OOP, parallel programming, high performance computing, and advanced codewriting.
